    <p style="color:black;">Hi there! My name is Krishna and I have been teaching for the past 15 years. I am passionate about education and love sharing my knowledge with others.</p>
    
    <p style="color:black;">In my classes, I specialize in teaching mathematics and coding. I work with both high school and undergraduate students, helping them develop their skills in subjects like C++, Python, and Java. I believe that understanding coding languages is not only essential for today's technological world but also a great way to develop problem-solving skills.</p>
    
    <p style="color:black;">Aside from mathematics and coding, I also have a keen interest in history. I teach European and Indian history, providing my students with insights into the rich cultural heritage and significant events that have shaped our world.</p>
    
    <p style="color:black;">When I'm not teaching, you can find me exploring new topics, reading books, or spending time with my family.</p>
